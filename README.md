# Potential Nomac

Potential Nomac is a Django app built with Python 3.11. It provides the authentication api's using Djangoâ€™s authentication, connecting with Redis for getting the cached data and providing the analytics based api for visualizing the data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11 or above
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rafimashood/nomac-poc-be.git
    cd potential_nomac
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3.11 -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

    Make sure you are in the project directory, then install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Setup Database (if applicable):**

    If your app uses a database, you need to run the migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Run the development server:**

    After setting up, you can start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Usage

To run your Django app, you can use the following commands:

- Run the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

- Create a superuser (admin):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

## Additional Notes

- If you need to install specific dependencies for your environment, edit `requirements.txt` or install them manually using `pip install package_name` and add to the `requirements.txt` later use.
- Make sure to set up your env variable configurations in `.env`
